# Pothole Detection using Adaptive Thresholding & Texture Analysis

## Problem Statement
Detect potholes on road images by analyzing **texture changes** with filters and **adaptive thresholding** techniques.

## Objectives
- Detect potholes on road surfaces.
- Use classical Computer Vision (CV) instead of deep learning.
- Highlight potholes using bounding boxes.

## Core Techniques
- Image Preprocessing (Grayscale, Gaussian Blur)
- Edge Detection & Adaptive Thresholding
- Morphological Operations
- Contour Detection & Filtering

## Dataset Description

This dataset consists of a combination of road images sourced from Google and an existing pothole dataset available on Kaggle. It is organized into three directories: train, val, and test.
* The train folder contains 1,167 images
* The validation (val) folder contains 108 images
* The test folder contains 136 images<br>
Each image is labeled as either "Normal" (no pothole) or "Pothole" based on its content.
